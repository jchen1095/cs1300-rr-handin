            <h2>Website</h2>
            <p>Website: <a href="https://www.artsocked.com/">https://www.artsocked.com/</a></p>
            <img src="artsocked.png" width="600" height="300">
            <p>This is a simple, small business website for an online sticker shop. I chose this website because it’s a small business’s website, so there is probably not a UI/UX designer assigned to creating their digital media.            </p>
            <h2>Observations & Problems</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The large home page image/div is disproportionally large compared to other items. Per Lecture 6: "Layout," it is important to create layouts/website structures that incorporate color and grouping to assist the user in understanding and accessing the website.
                    When I squint my eyes, which 'blurs' the website, I can only make out the "Welcome to artsocked" heading and the large picture. The text of the navigation bar and the company title/purpose statement blends into the background or vanishes.
                    Evaluating the layout of a website by blurring it was an exercise used in Lecture 6.
                </li>
                <li>The text on the homepage of this website loads in slowly, taking at least a couple of seconds. Moreover, some text doesn't load unless the user 
                    scrolls into the general area on that page where the text exists. This is not only frustrating to use, but also could cause issues with accessibility if users need
                    to have all text present to comfortably and effectively use the website. 
                </li>
                <li>Font size for the pages on the navigation bar are very small which make the pages difficult to find.</li>
                <li>The "shop now" button's font is also very small and low-weight, which makes the text difficult to see and understand.
                    Moreover, on PC the button is located on the very bottom of the website due to the large height of the header, 
                    which further disrupts the layout as the button is not located in proximity/in the same central area on the front
                    part of the home screen as the heading and most of the image</li>
                <li>The top left and right corners are crowded with information that also exists in very small font. 
                    Since there is high similarity between the name of the company, the purpose statement, and the page titles in the navigation bar, it is 
                    difficult to distinguish these elements.
                </li>
                <li>In conclusion, there are many ideas/statements on this home page but the lack of grouping and visual hierarchy disrupts the flow and communication of ideas</li>
            
            </ol>
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Multiple empty or nonexistant form labels for the "contact us" form</li>
                <li>Several low-contrast errors across the home page</li>
                <li>20 alerts related to poor image alternative text labeling, redundant links, and very small text</li>
                
            </ol>
